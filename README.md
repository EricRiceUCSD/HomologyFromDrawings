# HomologyFromDrawings
Source code for Math 273B final project on computational algebraic geometry

The app runs upon execution of HomologyApp.py, which must be in the same directory as HomologyFunctions.py.
Two image files CanvasPNG.png and CanvasPostscript.eps may be created and/or written to during mainloop.

The user must have Ghostscript installed for postscript image processing.

Required packages are
- tkinter (for the GUI)
- PIL (Python Image Library) or Pillow
